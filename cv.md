Hello. My name is Kiril Yastremski. You can contact with me by phone(**+375447453307**) or email(yastremskykirill@gmail.com), also i have a page on vk (https://vk.com/id155624232).

  
I'm a begginer on programming and i haven't the real experience, but i'm try very hard.

  
My strengths :
* ability to self-learning;
* effective time-management;
* discipline.

My skills:
* JS;
* HTML;
* CSS.

   There are example of my code from codewars:
 ```JavaScript
var isAnagram = function(test, original) {
  test = test.toLowerCase();
  original = original.toLowerCase();
  let arr1= test.split("").sort().join().trim();
  let arr2= original.split("").sort().join().trim();
return arr1==arr2 ? true:false;
};
```

   What about my education, I'm learning by myself. I'm read the programming books and use codewars for practise. Some experience i got on university, but my speciality had a little connect with programming.
  
   My english level is pre-intermediate, but i'm also increase my skill in this area.
